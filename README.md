# linear_regression

The dataset contains many features of a tennis match, I tried to gather information about all the features to predict which features may affect the outcomes of the match (winnings).
I then created a multi linear_regression model that maximize the coefficient of determination $R^2$ by excluding irrelavent features to the outcome.
